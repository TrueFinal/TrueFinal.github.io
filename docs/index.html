        <h1>Hi, and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>Hello, how are you? Thank you for showing interest in taking a look at my portfolio. My name is Murillo Gabriel, and I live in Goiânia, in the state of Goiás, Brazil. This year, I will begin my undergraduate studies in Computer Science. My main goal in creating this portfolio is to showcase some of my skills and projects that I have been developing. There are some links in the Projects tab that can provide a bit more insight into what I am talking about!</p>

            <p>Project of a Python-developed indexer with an RSS feed. I'm still develloping this project, I'm pretending to add some log functions to it, as a massage for some missing errors.</p>

            <h3>ACAD Project</h3>
            <p>Recently, I have been taking some classes on Data Analisys and its processes (BI, ETL, Data Lakes, Data Science libraries, etc.). This is a project developed with some classmates as part of the completion of the first part of our training course. The project we developed was intended to be a management system for educational institutions. Through it, I was able to further enhance my skills as a Python developer, code debugging, and Scrum methodologies.</p>
