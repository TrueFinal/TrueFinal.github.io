        <h1>Hi, and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>Hello, how are you? Thank you for showing interest in taking a look at my portfolio. My name is Murillo Gabriel, and I live in Goiânia, in the state of Goiás, Brazil. This year, I will begin my undergraduate studies in Computer Science. My main goal in creating this portfolio is to showcase some of my skills and projects that I have been developing. There are some links in the Projects tab that can provide a bit more insight into what I am talking about!</p>

    <section id="sobre" style="display: none;">
        <p>This section of my portfolio I want to dedicate to talking a bit about myself. I can start by explaining why I want to enter the IT field in general. From a very young age, I always had a lot of curiosity about how things work in general, so I used to break my toys to see how they worked inside. As time went by, when I was a bit older, I discovered something called the Internet, which operated inside computers, phones, and was everywhere. I vividly remember a day when we were at the house of a beloved aunt, my cousin, who was already in the final year of her Computer Science degree, was accessing her work computer. At first, I was amazed, and I thought, 'What kind of sorcery is this?' When I saw that, I was enchanted, and I thought, 'I need to learn how she does that.' So, I decided right then that I would find out how she did it. A few more years passed, and that little boy grew up. When the time came to decide which college to attend, without thinking twice, I chose Computer Science as well. Unfortunately, it was a very turbulent year for me, and I couldn't enter college this year, but I don't let it discourage me. I will work hard to make my dream come true. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to dedicate this small space to my dear cousin, Hayanne. Thank you for everything you have done until today, and perhaps without knowing it, you changed my way of seeing things. Despite everything that happened, all the problems, you never stopped supporting and trusting me, being a rock for me, helping and encouraging me. So, thank you, and Te amu!</p>

            <h3>Murillo Calculos-3000 (Python Calculator)</h3>
            <p>One of my first projects, designed to be a simple calculator, it helped me to enhance my Python programing skills.</p>

            <h3>Python Indexer with RSS feed</h3>
            <p>Project of a Python-developed indexer with an RSS feed. I'm still developing this project; I'm pretending to add some log functions to it, as a massage for some missing errors.</p>

            <h3>ACAD Project</h3>
            <p>Recently, I have been taking some classes on Data Analysis and its processes (BI, ETL, Data Lakes, Data Science libraries, etc.). This is a project developed with some classmates as part of the completion of the first part of our training course. The project we developed was intended to be a management system for educational institutions. Through it, I was able to further enhance my skills as a Python developer, code debugging, and Scrum methodologies.</p>
